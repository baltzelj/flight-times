# flight-times
Calculates flight times based on arrival and departure times for a flight.

### Objective
My goal was to create a program that will calculate the flight time in hours and minutes based on the departure location/time and arrival location/time of a flight, accounting for time zones. Inspired by the user story [here](https://github.com/flightstats/nextjs-code-review-exercise).
